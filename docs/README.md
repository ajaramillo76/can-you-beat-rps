## Description

It's a rock, paper, scissors game against the computer.  As the game goes along, the computer learns your "pattern" (programming with statistics at first, but eventually using TensorFlow Lite for machine learning) over the course of a defined match and will output the symbol that will beat you.  So for example, if the match is twenty one games, the goal is that the computer will learn enough to win at least 51% of games to win the overall match everytime.  It uses the camera on your phone to capture your actual hand guestures of rock, paper or scissors.  Can you beat the computer?  Let's play!
